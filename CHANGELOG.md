- `RequestResponseExt` trait for response events.

### Changed

- Updated to Bevy 0.16
- Naming pass
  - `OnTypedResponse` -> `OnResponseTyped`
  - `RequestCompleted` -> `OnResponseString`
- Response as a component (`RequestResponse`) is now hidden behind `response_as_component` and likely to be removed in next release.
- `OnResponseTyped` has parsing done on creation. `result` field got renamed to `request` and `PhantomData` field got removed. One new field is `data` which holds `Option<T>` with parsing result.
